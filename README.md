I have created a GUI Calculator with the help of Tkinter python library in Visual Studio code
This is a simple  GUI calculator where one can add, subtract, multiply and divide the numbers.
in order to create a GUI Calculator first we need to install all the funtions and modules of tkinter python by writing this code "from tkinter import *"
after importing all the modules and functions we create a window 
after creating window chose a variable "StringVar() and make it global
After making the StringVar() a method is defined by the name "Click" which does all the mathematical operation in the GUI calculator and shows the result on the screen of the calculator.
after defining the method created all the button from 1 to 9 and other operation button like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, equal sign and clear button.
all the codes should be in between root.tk() and root.mainloop()
